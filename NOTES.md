## Notes

It's possible to set the fan to act as its own wireless access point.  This
functionality is not currently available in `haiku-senseme`, but the command
would look something like this:

```
<[fan id];NW;CREATE;[desired SSID];[desired password];192.168.1.1;255.255.255.0;192.168.1.1;ON>
```
